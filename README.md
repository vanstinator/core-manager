# Core Manager

### Installation Notes
_You're going to get scary warnings from both Chrome and Microsoft Smartscreen. The domain name and signing certificates for this project are both brand new. As more users download and use the tool these warnings will go away._

Core Manager is a small cross-platform tool to manage your emulation cores for Plex Arcade. Core Manager downloads, unpacks, and updates the xml mappings in Plex Media Server for you. In the future Core Manager will check for updates to existing cores and either alert you or automatically update them on a regular basis.

The latest release are available [on our releases page](https://github.com/vanstinator/core-manager/releases). There are installers for both Windows and macOS. Core Manager will check for updates whenever you use it and automatically update itself as newer versions become available.
